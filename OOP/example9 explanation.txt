Header File: #include <iostream> for input-output operations.

Namespace: using namespace std; to avoid writing std:: before cout.

Variable:

int i = 1; (initializes a counter variable i to 1).

Loop:

while (i <= 5) (runs the loop as long as i is less than or equal to 5).

cout << "This is iteration " << i << endl; (prints the current iteration number).

i++; (increments i by 1 in each iteration to avoid an infinite loop).
return 0;: Indicates successful program execution.
