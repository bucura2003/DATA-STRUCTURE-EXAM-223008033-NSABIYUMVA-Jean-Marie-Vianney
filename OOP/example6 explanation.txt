Library Inclusion:

#include <iostream>: This includes the input-output stream library, which is necessary for using cout to display output on the console.
Namespace:

using namespace std;: This allows the program to directly use components from the standard library (like cout) without needing to prefix them with std::.
Main Function:

The program begins execution in the int main() function.
Variable Declaration:

int age = 16;: The program declares an integer variable age and initializes it with the value 16.
Conditional Check:

The program checks if the value of age is greater than or equal to 18 using an if statement.
If age >= 18 is true (i.e., the person is 18 or older), it prints "You are an adult.".
If age is less than 18, the else block runs and prints "You are a minor.".
return 0;: This line signifies that the program has executed successfully and ends the main() function.
