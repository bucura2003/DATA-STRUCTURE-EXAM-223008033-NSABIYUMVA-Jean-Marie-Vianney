Header File: #include <iostream> for input-output operations.

Namespace: using namespace std; to avoid writing std:: before cout.

Loop:

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) (initializes i to 1, runs the loop as long as i <= 5, and increments i by 1 after each iteration).

cout << "This is iteration " << i << endl; (prints the current iteration number).

return 0;: Indicates successful program execution.
