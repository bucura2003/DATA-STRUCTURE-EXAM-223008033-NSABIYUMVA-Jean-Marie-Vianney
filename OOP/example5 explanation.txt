Library Inclusion:

#include <iostream>: This includes the input-output stream library, enabling the use of cout for printing output to the console.
Namespace:

using namespace std;: This allows the program to use standard library functions like cout without needing to prefix them with std::.
The program starts executing from the int main() function.
Variable Declaration:

int age = 18;: The program declares an integer variable age and initializes it with the value 18.
Conditional Check:

The program checks if age is greater than or equal to 18 using an if statement.
Since age = 18, the condition age >= 18 is true.
It then prints "You are an adult." to the console.
Program Termination:

return 0;: This line signifies the successful execution of the program and ends the main() function.
